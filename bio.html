		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Nicholas Jacobs, I was born in Milwaukee, Wi. I spent most of my childhood there, but after several years my family moved to Fishers, Indiana. We lived there for a few yars before moving to Needham, Massachusetts. I attended Buckingham Browne and Nichols, where I was a Captain for both the Basketball and Football teams. In highschool I was an Executive Board Member for Jack and Jill Organization.</p>
		<p>I came to Tufts as a Football recruit, but didn't end up playing for very long. I am a Film and Media Studies major and hope to work in the Gaming Industry as a Creative Director or Game Developer/Designer. I am working on a few projects right now that revolve around stories that I have written over the past year.</p>
