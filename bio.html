		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Nicholas Jacobs, I was born in Milwaukee, Wi. I spent most of my childhood there, but after several years my family moved to Fishers, Indiana. We lived there for a few yars before moving to Needham, Massachusetts. I attended Buckingham Browne and Nichols, where I was a Captain for both the Basketball and Football teams. In highschool I was an Executive Board Member for Jack and Jill Organization. I like spending my time working on my writing or making video games.</p>
